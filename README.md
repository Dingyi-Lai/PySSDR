# PySDDR

## What is this?
_Short intro on PySDDR and a figure which shows how it works? Would be good if we had a real use case example with DL being useful_
_Link to SDDR R code_
_Link to paper when available_

## Installation

To install the necessary packages for this framework run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using conda first install pip by: ```conda install pip```

## Model
_Briefly explain PySDDR structure and architecture -> that graph we were talking about would sure be nice_

## User inputs
_Here discuss and explain all the inputs the user must give_
### Data
_How data can be inputted_ 
### Distributions
_List of available distributions and params_
## Deep Neural Networks
_How a NN can be defined, e.g. by torch instances directly, loaded from script_

.

## Features
### Scientific features
_Here discuss the scientific features available to the user, e.g. w or w/o orthogonolization, optimizer options etc._
### Run/training features
<find a better name for run and training features:P>
_Here discuss the options available to the user while training, e.g. loading pretrained weights_

## Examples of using scientific features
```
this is an example, here we can link also to test_run.ipynb
```
_We should however add more content than currently in jupyter notebook_

 ## Examples of training features
```
this is an example, here we can link also to example_usage.ipynb
```


## Results
_Would be nice if eventually we have some nice results to show, though this is somehow similar to test_run.ipynb_
